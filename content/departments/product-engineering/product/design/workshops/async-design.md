# Async design workshop

If you want to avoid sync meetings and want to have a design workshop activity that can involve a large group of people you can consider an async design workshop.

The activities you do on a given day are flexible with this approach, so you can do problem validation, solution validation, brainstorming, and more; the important part is making it a multi-day activity with offsetting days for content creation and evaluation/voting, with a date boundary in between.

Benefits:

- Supports async work
- More flexibility when people are in lots of time zones
- Can support quite large groups
- Self-documenting

Drawbacks:

- Plays out slower than if everyone was in a live session together
- Not as engaging for people who are inspired by real-time communication
- Requires lots of written communication

## Offsetting days

The first thing you should do when planning the workshop is identify the list of activities you want to complete. You may do some problem exploration, followed by some customer research. A way you might structure that to use offsetting days is something like this:

- Monday: Problem exploration
- Tuesday (offset): Summarize problems found, team votes on ones that are most important
- Wednesday: Customer research on high importance problems
- Thursday (offset): Summarize research into common threads, vote on ones that seem most relevant

This rhythm of having a day for producing information and a day for summarizing it/voting on it keeps the team making forward progress, and supports people participating in all time zones. It also is tolerant of people joining late or dropping out early.

## Deliverables

On the non-offset days, it's important to structure your deliverables so that they can be shared easily. Written tends to be ideal, but videos are also good. So, if you're planning on doing some problem validation, you might have everyone record a short video of problems they are aware of with the product today.

These are easily watchable by everyone, and it's also easy to organize them into groupings the next day and vote on them.

## Coordination

You can coordinate the activity via a Slack channel. It is recommended to use a new, temporary channel for this purpose to avoid confusion from mixing messages. It can be helpful to have multiple facilitators spread across time zones to ensure someone is always around to answer any questions that come up.

Each day, a summary of the activities and deliverables for that day should be shared by someone in one of the early time zones. This will ensure everyone is always aware of what's expected of them that day.

## Additional options

Some people are inspired by working together sync, and may miss having real-time collaboration with others. An option you can give for people like this is to allow for sub-groups to form within the workshop who are in similar time zones and want to work together; they can then submit their daily deliverables as a group, and can thereby have the option to work on them together live.
